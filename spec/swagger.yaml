schemes:
  - http # Remove if your API doesn't support HTTP
  - https # Remove if your API donsn't support HTTPS
host: example.com # Replace with your hostname. You can also specify port e.g. example.com:777

    This is an **example** API to demontstrate features of OpenAPI specification
    # Introduction
    This specification is intended to to be a good starting point for describint your API in 
    [OpenAPI/Swagger format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md).
    It also demonstrates features of [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo) tool and 
    [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) documentation engine. So beyond the standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few 
    [vendor extensions](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).
    
    # OpenAPI Specification
    The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which
    allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source
    code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can 
    understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what
    interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the guesswork in calling the service.

  version: '1.0.0' # Your API version
  # It can be any string but it is better to use semantic versioning: http://semver.org/
  # Warning: OpenAPI require version to be string, but without quotation YAML can recognize it as number.

  title: Example.com # Replace with your API title
  # Keep it simple. Don't add "API" or verison at the end of the string.

  termsOfService: 'https://example.com/terms/' # [Optional] Replace with an URL to your ToS
  contact:
    email: contact@example.com # [Optional] Replace with your contact email
    url: 'http://example.com/contact' # [Optional] Replace with link to your contact form
